## Contributing
This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## Running the app
Simply begin the app to show a list of restaurants. You can select different categories of food by selecting the filter and choosing a different variety of options.

## Using the app
Begin the app by navigating to the website site or by downloading the app via gitHub. You can navigate through the restaurants manually by simply scrolling down, or you can click on the filter selector in order to filter the restaurants by neighborhoods and cuisines. Once you've clicked on a particular restaurant, a list of reviews will be included with the rest of the restaurants' information, including name, address, and location on the map!
